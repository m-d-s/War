Card Game War

1. Design a class to represent a playing card.

public class Card {

}

2. Using the Card class above, create an implementation of the following interface.

public interface Deck {

    /* Create the deck of cards */

    public void create( int numberOfSuits, int numberOfRanks );

    /* Shuffle the deck */

    public void shuffle();

    /* deal a card from the deck */

    public Card deal();

}

3. Using the CardDeck create a driver program that plays the card game War.

public class War {

    public void play( int numberOfSuits, int numberOfRanks, int numberOfPlayers ) { }

}
